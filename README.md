# Machine Learning Projects

A growing collection of applied machine learning projects documenting my progression toward ML engineering — with a focus on clean experimentation, solid evaluation, and production-minded workflows.

This repository is my personal lab for exploring different areas of machine learning, discovering what I enjoy most, and building an internship-ready portfolio over time.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Explore a wide range of ML domains (tabular data, NLP, computer vision, recommender systems, etc.)
- Practice end-to-end pipelines: preprocessing, feature engineering, training, evaluation, and iteration
- Transition from notebook-heavy exploration to modular, script-based code
- Develop engineering habits alongside theoretical understanding
- Maintain a clean, public portfolio that reflects consistent learning

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository contains multiple independent machine learning projects organized under the `projects/` directory.  
Each project follows a consistent, production-minded layout, typically including:
```
projects/ 
  └── project-name/ 
  ├── README.md 
  ├── data/ 
  │ ├── raw/ 
  │ └── processed/ 
  ├── notebooks/ 
  ├── src/
  ├── ...
```

Projects are categorized inside their READMEs (e.g., classification, NLP, computer vision) rather than by top-level folders.

## 📓 Notebooks vs. Scripts

- **Notebooks** are used for exploration, EDA, and prototyping.
- **`src/` scripts** contain reusable logic for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- As projects mature, core logic is moved from notebooks into modular code.

This mirrors a research-to-production workflow commonly used in real ML systems.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Across projects, I frequently use:

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (for deep learning projects)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter

Specific stacks are documented per project.
